# Classify Startup
This project works on predictive analysis to improve the decision making of the venture capitalists 
of their investments in the startups. Using various classification methods, a prediction can be made
considering various factors like startup locations, funding rounds, category, status of the company
and so on. Using these factors the prediction based system will suggest the venture capitalist if the 
startup he wants to invest on will go bankrupt or not in the near future. The test dataset which is used 
in this project is based on the CrunchBase API. Analysis is performed using Logistic Regression.
